    \subsection{General introduction to boundary conditions}\label{subsec:General introduction to BC}
    \subsubsection{Equations of boundary conditions}\label{subsubsec:Equations of BC}
	  Boundary conditions (BC) are necessary for solving the  Maxwell's equations by using FDTD. They can limit the computation in a finite space but attaining the same solution just as in  infinite space.  \\
	  The following equations are the general boundary conditions at  arbitrary interface between two medium. There can be  charges (denoted as charge density $\rho_s$) or  currents (denoted as surface electric current density $\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s$ and  surface magnetic current density $\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s$) at the interface:
	  %%%%% BC EQ
	      \begin{eqnarray}
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{D}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{D}}_1) &=&\rho_s  \\
		  \hat{n}\cdot(\vec{\mathbf{B}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{B}}_1) &=&0  \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{E}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{E}}_1) &=&-\vec{\mathbf{M}}_s \\
		  \hat{n}\times(\vec{\mathbf{H}}_2-\vec{\mathbf{H}}_1) &=&\vec{\mathbf{J}}_s
		  \label{eq:General boundary conditions}
	      \end{eqnarray}

    \subsubsection{Four  types of boundary conditions in OpenEMS}\label{subsubsec:Four particularly usefull BC}
	Under some special given conditions or assumptions, the boundary conditions(\ref{eq:General boundary conditions}) have  respective forms and they are convenient for the most simulations. These BC are called as:
       \begin{myindentpar}[2cm]
	       perfect electric conductor (\textbf{PEC}), \\
	     perfect magnetic conductor (\textbf{PMC}),\\
	      \textbf{MUR} absorbing boundary condition,\\
              perfectly matched layer (\textbf{PML}) absorbing boundary condition.
       \end{myindentpar}
The types of these BC are stored in \matv{BoundaryCond}, a field of the structure  \matv{FDTD} in MATLAB. \phantomsection \label{para:BoundaryCond}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BC
    \begin{FontPara}{BC} \phantomsection \label{para:BC}
   \matv{BC} provides the types of the boundary conditions to the 6 boundaries in the 3D simulating space.
          \matv{BC} is defined either as a \textbf{vector} or as a \textbf{cell} with 6  elements in MATLAB. \vspace{2mm}\\
          If  \matv[para:T_xmin]{T\_xmin}\phantomsection \label{para:T_xmin},
	  \matv[para:T_xmax]{T\_xmax}\phantomsection \label{para:T_xmax},
	  \matv[para:T_ymin]{T\_ymin}\phantomsection \label{para:T_ymin},
	  \matv[para:T_ymax]{T\_ymax}\phantomsection \label{para:T_ymax},
	  \matv[para:T_zmin]{T\_zmin}\phantomsection \label{para:T_zmin} and
	  \matv[para:T_zmax]{T\_zmax}\phantomsection \label{para:T_zmax} are  arguments which denote for the types of the conditions at the respective boundaries, then \matv{BC} can be defined as a vector or a cell as following.\vspace{2mm}\\
    \begin{itemize}
       %%%%%%%%%%%% vector BC
        \item  \matv{BC} is defined as a \textbf{vector}
	\begin{myindentpar}
% 	  \lstset{caption={\matv{BC} in the form of a vector},label=BCinvector}
	  \begin{lstlisting}[caption={\matv{BC} in the form of a vector},label=BCinvector]
 BC=[T_xmin T_xmax T_ymin T_ymax T_zmin T_zmax];
	  \end{lstlisting}
          Each  element (\matv[para:T_xmax]{T\_*min} or\matv[para:T_xmax]{T\_*max}) of the vector  must be  one of the following numbers
	    \begin{myindentpar}
	      \matval{0}   \qquad  (for PEC)\\
	      \matval{1}   \qquad  (for PMC)\\
	      \matval{2}   \qquad  (for MUR)\\
	      \matval{3}   \qquad  (for PML with 8 default layers).
	    \end{myindentpar}
      \end{myindentpar}
          %%%%%%%%%%%% Cell BC
          \item   \matv{BC} is defined as a \textbf{cell}
	  \begin{myindentpar}
% 	   \lstset{caption={\matv{BC} in the form of a cell},label=BCincell}
	  \begin{lstlisting}[caption={\matv{BC} in the form of a cell},label=BCincell]
 BC={T_xmin T_xmax T_ymin T_ymax T_zmin T_zmax};
	  \end{lstlisting}
	  of which   each  element(\matv[para:T_xmax]{T\_*min} or\matv[para:T_xmax]{T\_*max})  must be set as one of the following strings
	  \begin{myindentpar}
	     \matval{PEC} \qquad   (for PEC)\\
	     \matval{PMC} \qquad   (for PMC)\\
	     \matval{MUR}  \qquad  (for MUR)\\
	     \matval{PML\_x} \qquad   (for PML. \texttt{x} is  the PML size. It should be replaced with an integer in an interval from 4 to 50).
	  \end{myindentpar}
	\end{myindentpar}
\end{itemize}
	  So the element \texttt{BC}($i$) or \texttt{BC}\{$i$\} represents for the type of the  condition at the respective boundary as showed in the following table
	  \begin{table}[htb]\centering
	  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
	  \texttt{BC($i$)} or \texttt{BC\{$i$\}} & Respective position of the boundary\\ \hline
		 \texttt{BC(1)} or  \texttt{BC\{1\}} & where x or $\rho$ is minimum\\
		 \texttt{BC(2)} or  \texttt{BC\{2\}}& where x or $\rho$ is maximum\\
		 \texttt{BC(3)} or  \texttt{BC\{3\}}& where y or $\varphi$ is minimum\\
		 \texttt{BC(4)} or  \texttt{BC\{4\}}& where y or $\varphi$is maximum\\
		 \texttt{BC(5)} or  \texttt{BC\{5\}}& where z is minimum\\
		 \texttt{BC(6)} or  \texttt{BC\{6\}}& where z is maximum.

	\info{In a cylindrical system,  the elements of \matv{BC} represent for the types of boundary conditions at $\rho$, $\varphi$, $z$ instead of at $x, y, z$ (see listing \ref{ListingCylinBC}). If there are no  BC at $\rho\_min=0$ or at $\varphi$,   the elements of  \matv{BC} for the  corresponding boundaries conditions   can be set as \matval{0} or \matval{PEC} just in a virtual form for computation(see listing \ref{listing:SettingofBC in a cylin.}). For these cases, the corresponding elements have nothing to do with the boundaries conditions indeed.} \\
